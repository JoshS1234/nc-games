What is this repo???

This is a react app which will display data about (fictional) board games. It has data about the games themselves, reviews, users, and comments. Users will be able to login, read and vote on reviews, post comments, and delete their own comments.

##

Requirements

This was developed using Node v18.8.0
It may work on versions lower than this but if it isn't check that you are updated to these versions

Basic setup

###

Step 1: Cloning the repo
(if you want to have ownership of a copy of the repo) press "fork" from the repo from here: https://github.com/JoshS1234/nc-games
Navigate using the linux terminal to the desired location for the local copy of the repo
use "git clone https://github.com/JoshS1234/nc-games" (if not forked) OR "git clone <your github link>" (if forked)
install any dependencies: use the linux command "npm i" when you are in the repo directory

Step 2:

use "npm start" to locally host the API, it will default to port 9090.

Using the API

The user will be on the homepage from the base URL. In order to comment or post/delete, the user will need to login. This is done from the users page (or by pressing login on the current user card).
